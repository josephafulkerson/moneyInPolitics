          Money has the power to influence legislation and even elections.
          Explore this app to see where legislators are getting their
          contributions. Once on the home page, you can search a legislator by
          name, or filter legislators by party affiliation. You can then visit
          their website by clicking the link on their card, or view their top
          ten contributors by donation value.
