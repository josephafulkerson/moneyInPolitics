MoneyInPoltics is an application that allows you see current legislators, as well as their top contributions by donation value.
Explore this app to see where legislators are getting their financial contributions. Once on the home page, you can search a legislator by name, or filter legislators by party affiliation. You can then visit their website by clicking the link on their card, or view their top ten contributors by donation value.
